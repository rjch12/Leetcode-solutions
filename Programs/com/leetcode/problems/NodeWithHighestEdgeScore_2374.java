/*
 * 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score (https://leetcode.com/problems/node-with-highest-edge-score/)
 * You are given a directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, where each node has exactly 
 * one outgoing edge.
 * 
 * The graph is represented by a given 0-indexed integer array edges of length n, where edges[i] 
 * indicates that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i].
 * 
 * The edge score of a node i is defined as the sum of the labels of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to i.
 * 
 * Return the node with the highest edge score. If multiple nodes have the same edge score, 
 * return the node with the smallest index.
 * Example: 
 * Input: edges = [1,0,0,0,0,7,7,5]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * - The nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
 * - The node 0 has an edge pointing to node 1. The edge score of node 1 is 0.
 * - The node 7 has an edge pointing to node 5. The edge score of node 5 is 7.
 * - The nodes 5 and 6 have an edge pointing to node 7. The edge score of node 7 is 5 + 6 = 11.
 * Node 7 has the highest edge score so return 7.
