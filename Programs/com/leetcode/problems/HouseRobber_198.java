/**
 * 198. House Robber https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, 
 * the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and 
 * it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can 
 * rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
